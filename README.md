# Cryptography Toolbox 💼🔒

Welcome to the Cryptography Toolbox! This open-source repository is your ultimate destination for learning and implementing various cryptographic techniques to secure your data. Developed by **Samael3003** and guided by **Prof. Dr. Vijay Mane Sir**, this toolbox is here to make cryptography accessible and fun. 🚀

## Features 🌟

The Cryptography Toolbox offers a user-friendly command-line interface with a collection of encryption methods that you can explore and experiment with:

1. **Caesar Cipher** 🔑: Shift characters in a message.
2. **Columnar Transposition** 📝: Rearrange characters using a key.
3. **Row Transposition** 📊: Similar to Columnar Transposition, but rearranged in rows.
4. **Monoalphabetic Substitution** 🔄: Substitute characters with shuffled alphabets.
5. **Rail Fence Transposition** 🚄: Create a zigzag pattern of characters.
6. **Vigenere Cipher** 🗝️: Use a keyword for polyalphabetic substitution.

## Usage 🚀

The project provides clear and intuitive interfaces for both encryption and decryption, complete with detailed timing information for performance analysis. Feel free to choose the encryption technique you find fascinating and dive into the world of cryptographic algorithms.
